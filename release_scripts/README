This directory contains a quick and dirty set of scripts that
can be used too automate LS release process.

* Changelog.sh: parses the "svn log" output and generates a changelog like file
  * ParseSVNLogs.php: an helper script used by Changelog.sh. Don't need to run it
* PackageLS.sh:
  * export the svn tree, 
  * updates common.php, 
  * packages archives files,
  * optionally upload to Sf.net

Sample Session:
1- I run Changelog.sh
	Updating SVN local repository
	Current Repository build is 5948,
	  Let's assume you're preparing the build 5949 release
	Please enter the last release buildnumber: 5884
	Getting SVN log in XML format from 5884 to 5949
	Parsing SVN log in XML format ==> Changelog-LS-5884-5949.txt
	Now you have to:
	 * review the generated changelog in /var/www/html/limesurvey-devel/Changelog-LS-5884-5949.txt
	 * then add it to the relevant section in the release-notes
	 * commit the new release notes
	 * and run the PackageLS.sh script to build and upload the packages to Sf.net

2- I manualy add the generated changelog to source/limesurvey/docs/release_notes_and_upgrade_instructions.txt and I svn commit to the SVN server

3- I run ./PackageLS.sh
Updating the repository first
