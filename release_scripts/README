This directory contains a quick and dirty set of scripts that
can be used too automate LS release process.

* Changelog.sh: parses the "git log" output and generates a changelog like file
* Package.sh:
  * export the related branch, 
  * updates version.php, 
  * packages archives files,
  * optionally upload to Sf.net

Sample Session:
1- I run Changelog.sh
	Updating local repository
	Current Repository build is 5948,
	  Let's assume you're preparing the build 5949 release
	Please enter the last release buildnumber: 5884
	Now you have to:
	 * review the generated changelog in /var/www/html/limesurvey-devel/Changelog-LS-5884-5949.txt
	 * then add it to the relevant section in the release-notes
	 * commit the new release notes
	 * and run the PackageLS.sh script to build and upload the packages to Sf.net

2- I manualy add the generated changelog to source/limesurvey/docs/release_notes.txt and I git commit and push to the Git repository

3- I run ./Package.sh
Updating the repository first
